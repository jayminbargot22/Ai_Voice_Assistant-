# üó£Ô∏è VoiceAssistant-Py

A Python-based voice assistant that recognizes spoken commands and performs actions like opening websites, telling the time or date, and entering sleep mode after inactivity. This project uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities for a smooth and interactive assistant experience.

## üöÄ Features

- üé§ Voice command recognition
- üí¨ Text-to-speech (TTS) responses
- üåê Open popular websites via voice (YouTube, Google, WhatsApp, etc.)
- ‚è∞ Time and date response
- üò¥ Auto-sleep mode after 1 minute of inactivity
- üìú Conversation logging in terminal
- üõë Safe shutdown via `"exit"` or `Ctrl+C`

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [`speech_recognition`](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [`pyttsx3`](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
- [`webbrowser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html)

## ü§ñ VOICE ASSISTANT - INSTALLATION 


Follow the steps below to install and run the Python Voice Assistant on your computer.

----------------------------------
STEP 1: CLONE THE GITHUB REPOSITORY

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

git clone https://github.com/jayminbaargot22/VoiceAssistant-Py.git
cd VoiceAssistant-Py


----------------------------------
STEP 2: INSTALL PYTHON

Make sure Python 3.8 or later is installed.

Check your Python version with:
python --version

If not installed, download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

----------------------------------
STEP 3: CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (Optional but Recommended)

Create:
python -m venv venv

Activate it:

For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

For Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

----------------------------------
STEP 4: INSTALL REQUIRED PACKAGES

If you have a requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Otherwise, install manually:
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio

NOTE: If 'pyaudio' causes errors on Windows,
download the .whl file from:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

Then install it with:
pip install path\to\downloaded\pyaudio.whl

----------------------------------
STEP 5: SET UP YOUR MICROPHONE

Make sure your system microphone is enabled and accessible.
This assistant uses your default input device to listen.

----------------------------------
STEP 6: RUN THE ASSISTANT

Start the program with:

python voice_assistant.py

----------------------------------
STEP 7: TRY THESE VOICE COMMANDS

- open youtube
- open whatsapp
- what's the time
- what's today's date
- wake up
- exit

----------------------------------
